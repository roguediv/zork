# zork
roguediv/zork is a text-based game similar to Zork that takes place in medieval times. You are a lawless assassin visiting a castle with a vengeance. You must fit in, accept contracts to make money, and buy improvements to your gear so you'll have the stength to take down the corrupt king. Talk to the peasents to gain knowledge of your target's locations. Sneak attack your targets when they least expect it using the intel you've gathered. Battle law enforcement who hunt you down using a turn based battle system. Explore the open world of the castle as you please.

## Game Features
* **Open World RPG.** Takes place during medieval times. Explore a castle and hunt down targets. 
* **Speech System.** Use your charisma skills to gather intel. 
* **Battle system.** Random encounters from law enforcement. You can optionally gather intel about your targets by participating in battles if your charisma fails. 
* **Upgrade Gear.** Use coin to purchase new and better items from the shop. This is how you progress dynamically through the game. Some targets are too tough to take down without upgraded gear.
